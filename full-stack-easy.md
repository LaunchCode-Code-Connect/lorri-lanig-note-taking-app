## Software Development - Beginner Difficulty

### Project Title: Simple Personal Note-Taking Application

---

**Premise:**

Create a full-stack personal note-taking application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their notes. The application should be straightforward and user-friendly, enabling users to create, view, edit, and delete their notes securely. This project is designed to help you understand the basics of full-stack development, including user authentication and CRUD operations.

### General Requirements:

#### Front-End:

- **User Interface (UI):**
    - **Authentication Pages:**
        - **Sign-Up Page:**
            - Users can register with a username and password.

        - **Login Page:**
            - Users can log in using their registered credentials.
        - **Logout Functionality:**
            - Users can securely log out of the application.
    - **Notes Dashboard:**
        - **Notes List:**
            - Display a list of all notes created by the logged-in user.
            - Each note shows the title and a snippet of the content.
        - **Create Note:**
            - A form to create a new note with a title and content.
        - **Edit Note:**
            - Ability to edit the title and content of an existing note.
        - **Delete Note:**
            - Option to delete a note with a confirmation prompt.
    - **Responsive Design:**
        - Ensure the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
    - **Styling:**
        - Use simple and clean styling to enhance user experience.
        - Optionally, use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Materialize for faster development.

#### Back-End:

- **APIs and Endpoints:**
    - **Authentication API:**
        - **POST /register:** Register a new user.
        - **POST /login:** Authenticate a user and provide a session or token.
        - **POST /logout:** End the user's session.
    - **Notes API:**
        - **GET /notes:** Retrieve all notes for the authenticated user.
        - **POST /notes:** Create a new note.
        - **PUT /notes/{id}:** Update an existing note.
        - **DELETE /notes/{id}:** Delete a note.
- **Database:**
    - **Entities:**
        - **Users:**
            - UserID (unique identifier)
            - Username
            - PasswordHash
        - **Notes:**
            - NoteID (unique identifier)
            - UserID (foreign key linking to Users)
            - Title
            - Content
            - CreatedAt
            - UpdatedAt
    - **Relationships:**
        - Each user can have multiple notes.
- **Security:**
    - **Authentication:**
        - Secure password storage using hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
        - Implement session management or token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
    - **Authorization:**
        - Ensure users can only access their own notes.
    - **Input Validation:**
        - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.

#### Additional Features (Optional):

- **Search Functionality:**
    - Allow users to search their notes by title or content keywords.
- **Note Sorting and Filtering:**
    - Sort notes by date created or title.
- **Rich Text Editor:**
    - Enhance the note editor to support basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline).
- **Dark Mode:**
    - Provide an option to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application on a platform like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify.
    - Provide documentation on how to set up and run the application.

### Constraints and Guidelines:

- **Programming Language Agnostic Back-End:**
    - You can use any back-end language and framework you are comfortable with (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django, Java with Spring Boot).
- **Front-End Framework (Optional):**
    - You may use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or a front-end framework/library like React, Vue.js, or Angular.
- **Development Practices:**
    - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track your changes.
    - Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
    - Structure your project directories logically.
- **Testing (Optional):**
    - Write basic tests for your back-end APIs and front-end components.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Implement proper error messages and user feedback for failed operations (e.g., failed login, validation errors).
